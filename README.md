# Daylio Viewer

A viewer for the .daylio database of the Daylio app.

## Usage

On Daylio, open up the "More" menu and swipe down to *Backup & Restore > Advanced Options > Export*, then load the exported file 
to the [application](https://lego4m.github.io/daylio-viewer).

⚠️ **Be careful!** *Anyone who has this file can view your diary, so keep that in mind.*

## How does it work?

The database file exported by Daylio uses Base64 encryption, this application decrypts it and organizes the elements on screen,
displaying all sorts of information about your diary.
